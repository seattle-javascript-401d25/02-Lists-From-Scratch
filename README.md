push - airty(...)
- The exported value from the push function should return an array length
- The data for each parameter can be any data type
- Valid use - arguments are added on to the last index of an array
- Invalid use - nothing is pushed to the array, and its length remains unchanged

forEach
Include your travis badge at the top of your `README.md` file
In your `README.md`, describe the exported values of each module you have defined. Every function description should include it's airty (expected number of parameters), the expected data for each parameter (data-type and limitations), and it's behavior (for both valid and invalid use). Feel free to add any additional information in your `README.md` that you would like.
